- 👋 Hi, I’m @jake-rodgers20
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics and all things science. I am a nerd at heart, but love playing and watcing almost any sport that involves a ball. 
Music is another love of mine, and it was hard to not continue in college!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying a Bachelors in Physics at Michigan State University, and have taken up an 
interest in coding and data science due to one of my required classes. Python is the first language I've been exposed to, but I plan to continue to learn new
languages and tools in the future.
